As an African maker myself, I'm well aware of [my own] needs which puts me in a pretty sweet spot: I myself am the user and the creator, at the same. This begs the question though, why build in public then?

From my experience (mostly by proxy), building in public is pretty great for many reasons:

1. A good reality check: You're constantly reminded to build something people want
2. You put your money where your mouth is; you don't _talk_ about what you're building, you actually **do** it.
3. Your users, stop being users/customers, rather they become collaborators. They can and are empowered to literally alter the current product trajectory (an MVP is a hypothesis right? so might as well tighten the feedback loop and shorten it)

Now, I hear you thinking: this is all nice and well on paper except you forgot one important caveat, **you're in Africa**: A continent where corruption runs rampant, where it has become a mentality and not just a behavior. Someone will probably steal your idea.

Yep, they might. And that's probably the worst that could happen. It's one-dimensional, so it's not really as bad as it seems.
