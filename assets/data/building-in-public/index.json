This begs the question though, why build in public then?</p>\n<p>From my experience (mostly by proxy), building in public is pretty great for many reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A good reality check: You're constantly reminded to build something people want</li>\n<li>You put your money where your mouth is; you don't <em>talk</em> about what you're building, you actually <strong>do</strong> it.</li>\n<li>Your users, stop being users/customers, rather they become collaborators. They can and are empowered to literally alter the current product trajectory (an MVP is a hypothesis right? so might as well tighten the feedback loop and shorten it)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, I hear you thinking: this is all nice and well on paper except you forgot one important caveat, <strong>you're in Africa</strong>: A continent where corruption runs rampant, where it has become a mentality and not just a behavior. Someone will probably steal your idea.</p>\n<p>Yep, they might. And that's probably the worst that could happen. It's one-dimensional, so it's not really as bad as it seems.</p>\n","tags":[{"title":"Eggnite","path":"/tag/Eggnite/"},{"title":"startups","path":"/tag/startups/"}]}},"context":{}}
